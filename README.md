Example game playing web servers
===
Based on the Github project [extreme startup servers](https://github.com/steria/extreme_startup_servers) - these are simple web server apps in a variety of languages that can be used as a skeleton to get people up and running quickly with a server that will be able to respond to requests from a game-master server.

I've put them in two folders

1. 'tested' - the ones that I've personally tested and know to be working, together with a README file that explains what needs to be done to get them up and running - some of the original code had to be fixed as it didn't work OOTB
1. 'untried' - ones that I haven't gotten around to testing yet, should work but YMMV
